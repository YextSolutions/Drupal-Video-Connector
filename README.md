# Product Description & Purpose

Power dynamic site search by syncing your Video Media Types from Drupal to Yext.
Drupal is a free, open-source content management system with a large, supportive
community. It is used by millions of people and organizations around the globe
to build and maintain their websites. Each media type connector will pull in a
different media type, so you will have to download multiple if you would like to
pull in Documents or Images.

The Drupal Video Connector automatically syncs your Video data to Yext on a
daily basis. Any time you add, update, or remove a Video media type in Drupal,
these same changes will occur in Yext. Now you can extend the reach of your
Drupal data even further to power Yext search experiences!

This app creates the following custom connectors:

- drupalVideo_videoConnector

This app creates the following custom entity type that correlates to the custom
connector:

- drupalVideo_video

This app creates the following custom fields:

- drupalVideo_createdDate
- drupalVideo_creator
- drupalVideo_videoURL

This app also adds two plugins, extractFileUrl and getUser.
